Word Search Algorithm

- place words in grid
	- get words array
	- divide it 40% across, 40 vertical, 20 diagonal
	- 3 different arrays? or randomly assigned at placement?
		- make sure words that will only fit diagonal are diagonal, etc.
		- place these restrictive words first
	- for the remaining words:
		- randomly generate spot in array 
		- check if row/column around it is available
			- empty or characters match
		- if yes, place word
		- if no, repeat
- fill gaps with random characters
	- iterate through array
		- if index contains null, place randomly generated char
